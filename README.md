# 🔒 Secure Talk: Encryption Hub  

Secure Talk is a web-based application designed to explore encryption techniques, 
including **RSA Algorithm** and **Caesar Cipher**. 
The project provides users with an interactive interface to 
generate keys, encrypt and decrypt messages, and learn about the algorithms.  

## ✨ Features  

- 🔑 **RSA Encryption & Decryption**:  
  - Generate RSA key pairs with user-defined key sizes.  
  - Encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA.  
  - View generated public and private keys in JSON format.
    
- 🔄 **Caesar Cipher**:  
  - Encrypt and decrypt messages with a user-defined shift value.  
  - Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.  
  - Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.  

- 🎨 **Responsive UI**:  
  - Built with **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** for modern design and responsiveness.  
  - Font customization using **Alegreya** and **Bokor** fonts.  

- 💬 **Interactive Modals**:  
  - User-friendly modals to display success and error messages.  

- 📚 **Informational Sections**:  
  - Learn about RSA Algorithm and Caesar Cipher through collapsible sections.  
  - About Developers section for project credits.
